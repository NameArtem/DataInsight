    "winter is here. You and your friends where tossing around a frisbee at the park when you made a wild throw that left the frisbee out in the middle of the lake. The water is mostly frozen, but there are a few holes where the ice has melted. If you step into one of those holes, you'll fall into the freezing water. At this time, there's an international frisbee shortage, so it's absolutely imperative that you navigate across the lake and retrieve the disc. However, the ice is splippery, so you won't always move in the diretion you intended. Teh surface is described by using a grid like the following:\n",

If the agen did indeed reach the frisbee then the episode finished at that time step. This means that for each episode the total reward received by the agent for the entire episode is either one or zero. For the first thousand episodes we can interpret the first score in the printout as meaning that 5% of the time the agent recieved a reward of one and won the episode. And by the last thousand episodes from a total of 10,000 the agent was winning 70% of the time and from the grid enviroment we can see that it is more likely for the agent to fall in a hole or perhaps reach the  the max number of time steps than it is to reach the frisbee. But reach the frisbee 70% of the time by the end of the training is not too bad especially since the agent had not explicit instructions to reach the frisbee in any case. It learned through reinforcement that this is the correct direction/action to do.\n",
