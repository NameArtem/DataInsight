A more meaningful choice for a predictive modeling is to choose the variable that has the highest information value. "

It seamlessly handles missing values and character variables, and the output is easy to interpret.\n",

It also supports exploratory analysis for uplift models, a growing area within marketing analytics. The information package is not designed to transfer data into WOE vectors for Naive Bayes models, although this feature could be added later."
